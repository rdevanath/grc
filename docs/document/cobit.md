# COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and related Technologies)

COBIT, developed by ISACA, is an IT governance and management framework that aligns IT processes with business goals, optimizes resource use, and provides metrics for performance and risk management.
COBIT 2019 organizes its governance system into five domains, each containing processes that represent key activities for managing and governing enterprise IT. These domains are split between `Governance Objectives and Management Objectives`.

**Five COBIT Domains and Their Process Groups**

| Domain | Type       | Purpose                                                                 |
|--------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EDM (Evaluate, Direct and Monitor) | Governance | Ensures stakeholder needs are evaluated, direction is set, and performance is monitored. |
| APO (Align, Plan and Organize)     | Management | Covers strategy, governance, and planning of IT. |
| BAI (Build, Acquire and Implement) | Management | Focuses on implementation and integration of IT solutions. |
| DSS (Deliver, Service and Support) | Management | Manages operational delivery of IT services. |
| MEA (Monitor, Evaluate and Assess) | Management | Evaluates performance, compliance, and internal controls. |

## Governance Domain

**EDM – Evaluate, Direct and Monitor**

**Purpose:** Provide board-level oversight to ensure IT delivers value, optimizes risk, and uses resources responsibly. Focuses on strategic oversight and decision-making.

    | Process | Purpose Statement                                      |
    |---------|--------------------------------------------------------|
    | EDM01   | Ensure Governance Framework Setting and Maintenance    |
    | EDM02   | Ensure Benefits Delivery                               |
    | EDM03   | Ensure Risk Optimization                               |

    | EDM05   | Ensure Stakeholder Engagement                          |

Each EDM process includes:

• **Purpose Statement:** Why the process exists. 

• **Process Practices:** Key activities to perform. e.g., define governance principles, monitor performance.

• **Inputs/Outputs:** Artifacts consumed and produced. E.g. governance policies, performance reports.

• **Goals & Metrics:** stakeholder satisfaction, risk posture.

• **Governance Components:** organizational structures, principles, policies.

## Management Domains

1.	Processes

2.	Organizational Structures

3.	Information

4.	Culture, Ethics and Behavior

5.	People, Skills and Competencies

6.	Services, Infrastructure and Applications

7.	Policies and Procedures

These components ensure that each process is actionable, measurable, and aligned with enterprise goals.
Goals and Metrics. COBIT uses performance management based on CMMI-like maturity levels - from Level 0 (Incomplete) to Level 5 (Optimizing).
