# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 - SP 800-53

## Introduction
The NIST CSF 2.0 is a voluntary, risk-based framework designed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology to help organizations of any size manage and reduce cybersecurity risk.

Core to CSF 2.0 are **six functions** that form a continuous improvement lifecycle:

- **Govern:** Establish governance policies, roles, and oversight (new in 2.0).

- **Identify:** Inventory assets, understand business context, and assess risk.

- **Protect:** Implement safeguards such as access control, training, and data security.

- **Detect:** Continuously monitor for anomalies and cybersecurity events.

- **Respond:** Plan and execute actions to contain and mitigate incidents.

- **Recover:** Restore systems and services while incorporating lessons learned.

**Implementation Tiers:** 
These describe the maturity of an organization's cybersecurity risk management, ranging from Partial (Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4), indicating a progression from less formal to more proactive approaches.

## NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5.1.1 controls
The most comprehensive and standardized catalog of security and privacy controls (it defines controls – not just policies) used across U.S. federal agencies, critical infrastructure, and increasingly by private enterprises for robust cybersecurity governance.

>Full name: Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations
 
**What Are NIST SP 800-53 Controls?**

- Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

- Provides a catalog of 400+ controls for securing information systems and protecting privacy.

- Used to implement FISMA, FedRAMP, and align with NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and other frameworks.

- Controls are grouped into 20 families, each addressing a specific security domain.

**Control Baselines - NIST defines three impact levels:**

- Low: ~149 controls

- Moderate: ~287 controls

- High: ~370 controls

These baselines help tailor control selection based on system sensitivity and risk exposure.

**Control Structure** - Each control includes:

- **Control statement:** What must be done (e.g., “The organization must manage user accounts.”).

- **Control enhancements:** Optional add-ons for higher assurance.

- **Discussion:** Rationale and examples.

- **Implementation guidance:** How to apply it in real-world systems.

**What’s New in Rev. 5.1.1 (2023–2025)**

- Rev. 5 (latest version) integrates privacy controls alongside security — making it suitable for GDPR, HIPAA, and other privacy regimes.

- New controls for identity providers, cryptographic key protection, and token management.

- Enhanced mappings to NIST CSF 2.0, ISO/IEC 27001:2022, and the NIST Privacy Framework.

- Leading zeros added to control IDs (e.g., AC-01 instead of AC-1) for consistency.
