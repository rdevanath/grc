# CIS’s - Critical Security Controls

Developed by the Centre for Internet Security, the CIS Controls are a prioritized, prescriptive set of 18 safeguards that address the most common cyberthreats. Formerly known as SANS 20.

## Summary of the 18 controls

1. **Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets:** Managing all hardware devices connected to the infrastructure for monitoring and protection.

2. **Inventory and Control of Software Assets:** Managing all software on the network, ensuring only authorized software is used.

3. **Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software:** Maintaining secure settings for all assets and software.

4. **Account Management:** Managing user account credentials and authorizations.

5. **Access Control Management:** Managing access credentials and privileges for all accounts.

6. **Audit Log Management:** Collecting, alerting on, reviewing, and retaining audit logs to aid in detecting and recovering from attacks.

7. **Data Protection:** Identifying, classifying, and securely handling data throughout its lifecycle.

8. **Data Recovery:** Establishing practices to restore assets to a trusted state after an incident.

9. **Incident Response Management:** Establishing a program to prepare for, detect, and respond to security incidents.

10. **Email and Web Browser Protections:** Enhancing protections against threats originating from email and web browsing.

11. **Continuous Vulnerability Management:** Regularly assessing and remediating vulnerabilities on all assets.

12. **Malware Defence:** Preventing the installation and execution of malicious code on enterprise assets.

13. **Network Infrastructure Management:** Securely managing network devices to prevent exploitation.

14. **Network Monitoring and Defence:** Maintaining comprehensive network monitoring to defend against threats.

15. **Application Software Security:** Managing the security of software throughout its lifecycle.

16. **Penetration Testing:** Testing the effectiveness of security controls by simulating attacker actions.

17. **Security Awareness and Skills Training:** Implementing a program to educate the workforce on security best practices. 

18. **Service Provider Management:** Evaluating service providers to ensure they adequately protect sensitive data and critical platforms.

## Three implementation Groups
The CIS Controls are structured into three Implementation Groups (IGs 1-3) to accommodate organizations of different sizes and with different resources.

• **IG1 (Basic Cyber Hygiene):** This group consists of 56 Safeguards and represents the minimum standard of information security for all enterprises. It focuses on essential practices to defend against the most common attacks.

• **IG2:** Building upon IG1, this group adds 74 Safeguards, addressing a wider range of threats and vulnerabilities and suitable for organizations with moderate complexity.

• **IG3:** This group encompasses all 153 Safeguards, offering comprehensive protection against advanced threats and designed for larger organizations with significant resources and expertise.
